# pybridge-tutorial
These scripts were developed for an introductory data analysis course using Python for the PyBridge Python tutorial series at the University of Michigan School of Information, a series of tutorials designed to intriduce Python beginners to the key Python tools for information analysis. Some of these scripts were developed using the Google Python Course materials.

Please feel free to edit and use these scripts for Python tutorials. The include self-testing code that evaluates when run as the main module (see code for details). If you have questions about how to use these scripts, would like the accompanying slides used to present them, or would like more information, please contact me using the information listed on my website at http://www.jpgard.com/ .
